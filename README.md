# DDCRAB
Your one-stop shop for good budgeting

This was a project built during Carleton University's Hackathon in 2020

The project consists of a web app that would gather expenses input by the user and use the data to determine your costs per month, as well as
implement a pie chart to show where expenses are being used.
